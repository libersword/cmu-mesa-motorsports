                        <h2> The Michigan Competion </h2>
                            <p>FSAE Michigan is the largest Formula SAE competition in the US. Teams from all over the world come and compete, traveling thousands of miles with entire teams to comete here. It is a fierce competition, and very tough to become established in the competition community. The concept behind Formula SAE is that a fictional manufacturing company has contracted a design team to develop a small Formula-style race car. The prototype race car is to be evaluated for its potential as a production item. The target marketing group for the race car is the non-professional weekend autocross racer. Each student team designs, builds and tests a prototype based on a series of rules whose purpose is both to ensure onsite event operations and promote clever problem solving. <a href="http://students.sae.org/cds/formulaseries/about/" target="_blank">More About FSAE</a></p>

                            <p>FSAE Lincoln is considerable smaller than FSAE Michigan, but the competition is just as fierce. The events are the same in both competitions, as is the scoring, but the competitors are usually based in the US. Lincoln has been more manageable to get to in the past from our Grand Junction Home Base, and was the competition that we pushed through to endurance. We would like to compete in both competitions, if possible, but the means to get there is always a challenge.</p>
